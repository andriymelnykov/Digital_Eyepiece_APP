# Digital_Eyepiece_APP
This app is developed for fast and ultra-fast EAA observations (Electronic Assisted Astronomy), mainly to be used with very fast optical systems in range F1.0-F3.0. It meant to be somewhere in between EAA and night vision, providing more real-time feeling and using exposure times in range 50ms .. 4s and integration times under 1 minute. The app can be of course used also with slower optics and longer exposures, and also with night vision devices, equipped with cameras.

This app can also output images on a second display, used as electronic eyepiece. Different types of electronic eyepieces can be configured, for bino or mono mode.
